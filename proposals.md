#### Project Teams
Teams should consist of 2 or 3 people. In addition, if you have a project in mind, please indicate briefly (1--2 sentences) what you are thinking. We have included a list of possible projects at the end of this document although you are not required to choose from these. 

**Submission**

* In class, please hand in one sheet of paper per team. 
* If you do not have a team, simply turn in a sheet with your name and we will match you up. 

#### Prospectus
Your reserach prospectus will contain an overview of the research problem, _your hypothesis<sup>1</sup>_, first pass at related work, a description of how you plan to complete the project, and metrics to decide _if it worked_.   A good prospectus is basically the skeleton of the full report.

Your prospectus should follow the example:

* [Click here for an example prospectus](./files/prospectus/prospectus.pdf)
* [Click here for the tex files](https://github.com/columbiaviz/columbiaviz.github.io/tree/master/files/prospectus)

It is _highly recommended_ that you come to office hours to discuss project ideas before writing the prospectus.

<sup>1</sup>This is science after all.

**Submission**

1. Rename the filename of your prospectus to the following format, last names should be in alphabetical order. `prospectus_<lastname1>_<lastname2>.._<lastnameN>.pdf`
2. [Upload the file by 11:59PM EST](https://www.dropbox.com/request/NT8wHw3Wjs98fFxeKR9G)

#### Poster Session
Your team will prepare and present a project poster at the end-of-course poster session.   This gives you an opportunity to present a short demo of your work and show what you have accomplished in the class!

**Submission**

* Simply attend and present at the poster session.

#### Report
You will prepare a conference-style report on your project with **maximum length** of 15 pages (10 pt font or larger, one or two columns, 1 inch margins, single or double spaced -- more is not better.) Your report should expand upon your prospectus and introduce and motivate the problem your project addresses, describe related work in the area, discuss the elements of your solution, and present results that measure the behavior, performance, or functionality of your system (with comparisons to other related systems as appropriate.)

Because this report is the primary deliverable upon which you will be graded, **do not treat it as an afterthought**. Plan to leave at least a week to do the writing, and make sure your proofread and edit carefully!

**Submission**

1. Rename the filename of your report to the following format, last names should be in alphabetical order. `report_<lastname1>_<lastname2>.._<lastnameN>.pdf`
2. [Upload the file by 11:59PM EST](https://www.dropbox.com/request/NT8wHw3Wjs98fFxeKR9G)

## What is Expected

Good class projects can vary dramatically in complexity, scope, and topic. The only requirement is that they be related to something we have studied in this class and that they contain some element of research -- e.g., that you do more than simply engineer a piece of software that someone else has described or architected. To help you determine if your idea is of reasonable scope, we will arrange to meet with each group several times throughout the semester.


## Project Suggestions

The following are examples of possible projects -- they are by no means a complete list and you are free to select your own projects.

#### Modalities

Make it talk

* Chat + Knowledge bases
* NLP + DB + Chat
* DNN + NLP --> Queries
* Presenting query results via analogy

Seeing is beleiving

* Data + VR/AR

#### Recommendations


#### Explanation

* Identify a context during data exploration (either in a visualization system, or via any other modality) where the user will natually ask "why?" and expect an explanation.
  Formalize the context, the problem and develop a prototype solution.
  * related: scorpion, dialectic

#### Cleaning

* Boostclean for streaming
* 

#### Core Data Processing for Viz

#### Pragmatics

Make it scale

* Take an existing large-scale data visualization and design a system that 1) increases its scale by 10x while preserving the same 
  interactivity, 2) reduces the latency by 10x while preserving the same scale, 3) or for bonus points does (1) and (2).
