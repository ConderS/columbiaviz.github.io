# Overview

When confronted with a new dataset, analysts rely on visual interactive systems to explore and understand the data. This course surveys the landscape interactive data exploration systems along several axes. 1) what interaction modalities do modern systems provide? 2) how are such systems developed and optimized to ensure interactivity? 3) what novel functionality can drastically enhance the user's understanding of the dataset? Students will foundational as well as cutting-edge papers, present and lead a paper discussion at least once, and complete a semester-long research or implementation project. Familiarity with basic databases, machine learning, and algorithms is expected.
