        Human beings rely on summarizing and visualizing data to make informed decisions.  The number and volume of data continues to increase at exponential rates, and new user-facing systems and modalities are needed to handle the scale and heterogeneity of future data.
        This course surveys the landscape interactive data exploration systems along several axes.

## Course Expectations

**What This Class is NOT**  

* Our goal is *not* to learn how to make pretty visualizations.  Our goal is to understand how modern systems are engineered, and explore the research opportunities in visual data exploration.

**Prerequisites**

* Students should be comfortable reading research papers; you will read, answer questions, and comment on the readings before class.
* Students should be comfortable coding data processing systems;  familiarity with database query execution, some machine learning, and algorithms is expected.    
* Students are expected to active participate in discussion in class; participation is a large part of the grade.
* Students should be comfortable conducting a research project and writing up the results in a research paper format.
