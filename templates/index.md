### Description

When confronted with a new dataset, analysts rely on visual interactive systems to explore and understand the data. This course surveys the landscape interactive data exploration systems along several axes. 

1. What interaction modalities do modern systems provide? 
2. How are such systems developed and optimized to ensure interactivity? 
3. What novel functionality can drastically enhance the user's understanding of the dataset? 

Students in this class will be expected to

* Read and comment on foundational as well as cutting-edge papers
* Present and lead a paper discussion at least once
* Complete a semester-long research or implementation project
* Actively participate in discussions

**What This Class is NOT:**  Our goal is *not* to learn how to make pretty visualizations.  
Our goal is to understand how modern systems are engineered, and explore the research opportunities in visual data exploration.

**Prerequisites:** Students should be comfortable reading and coding data processing systems.   Familiarity with database query execution, machine learning, and algorithms is expected.
